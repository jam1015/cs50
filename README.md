# CS50 2021
This is my completed CS50x 2021 coursework. I did all labs and assignments.  Where there was a choice between a harder and easier version of an assignment, I always opted for the harder one. 

Ok that's a little bit of a lie! I still have to do problem set 0, scratch.  Skipped it because I wanted to dive right into C.  I plan on doing scratch some day, but I'm not sure when.
