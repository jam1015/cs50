			A recipe I like is to fry some onions up really good!
		</div>
		<p>
		<ol>
			<li>You dice them up and salt them generously but not excessively. </li>
			<li>Then you add some grease to the pot; not butter because we'll be using high heat, but good options might
				be ghee, scmaltz, or olive oil. </li>
			<li>Then you put the onions in and mix it in with the fat! </li>
			<li>At first the onions will be steaming and boiling, but by the end whey they've shrunk, they'll be frying!
			</li>
			<li>Fry them slowly until they're completely browned; ideally just to the point when they'd start burning,
				but not burned at all; really takes discipline and judgement. Ok!that's the recipe.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<ul>
			<li> Make sure you don't burn them </li>
			<li> really great for any dish! put it in soup! put it on pizza, or just melted cheese on bread!</li>
		</ul>
